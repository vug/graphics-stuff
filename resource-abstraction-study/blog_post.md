Currently I'm at parental leave. I had started working as a graphics engineer professionally last year, and worked for a solid 9 months. :-) And more than half of that time I started writing C++ for work. So, I'm at the beginning of my graphics programming journey. Slowly grasping concepts and design patterns common to rendering and why and how C++ is used commonly in this domain.

When writing software one usually borrows certain functionalities from external libraries, or from the operating system etc. And frequently occurring usages of functionalities, or, domain specific concepts that rely on those functionalities are wrapped into abstractions, i.e. to classes that correspond to a specific concept.

In real-time graphics programming the most common approach is to use a graphics library API that utilizes the GPU. These APIs, [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), [DirectX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX), Vulkan being the main ones, provide commands that use the graphics card drivers using which one feeds the necessary data to the GPU and run the draw call commands on them. Please see Section [1.2 What is the OpenGL Graphics System?](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf) of "The OpenGLÂ® v4.6 Core Profile Specifications" for a more in depth explanation of what a graphics API is.

As an example, they provide a variety of buffers (types of memory allocations) such as vertex array, vertex buffer and index buffer, using which we can implement a graphics concept called a Mesh, that describes a geometry in space. A vertex buffers hold the data about vertices that makes a geometric object such as vertex positions, surface normals, colors assigned to vertices etc., index buffer holds the information about how (usually triangular) faces are made out of those vertices. A Vertex Array combines vertex buffers and index buffers and it can store one or more meshes in it. (See [OpenGL - Vertex Specification](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification))

In general, these objects that are provided by the API for rendering, such as buffers, textures etc. can be called resources. APIs have functions to create a resource and the CPU side refers to them via handles. For example, in OpenGL the function to create a Vertex Array is [`glGenVertexArrays`,](https://docs.gl/gl4/glGenVertexArrays) and for buffer is [`glGenBuffers`](https://docs.gl/gl4/glGenBuffers)

In below functions, first parameter indicates how many of these objects we are going to create, and second parameter is a pointer to the id/handle of the first of them.

```cpp
int vao, vbo, ebo;
glGenVertexArrays(1, &vao);
glGenBuffers(1, &vbo);
glGenBuffers(1, &ebo);
```

In OpenGL the handles are simple integers (more specifically typedef'd `unsigned int` as `GLuint`. In theory, in a different implementation of OpenGL `GLuint` might correspond to a different data structure.) In Vulkan they are more obscure types that wrap some pointers.

Once the resource is acquired using the generation function we can call further functions on them to use them. For example, [`glBindBuffer`](https://docs.gl/gl4/glBufferData) is to select a buffer, and [`glBufferData`](https://docs.gl/gl4/glBufferData) can be used to allocate memory on GPU and upload data from CPU memory to GPU into selected buffer.

```cpp
std::vector<MyVertex> vertices = { ... }
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(MyVertex) * vertices.size() , vertices.data(), GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

Above code assumes that the vertex data is stored in a `vector` of `MyVertex` structs, then selects the created vertex buffer using its handle, then uploads the data from the vector in CPU memory to GPU memory.

These type of operations happen a lot in a rendering system, it's better to abstract away the direct OpenGL calls behind a Mesh class.

There is a programming pattern called [RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization), which stands for "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization". It is the approach for acquiring the resources at object creation and deleting them at object destruction automatically, so that, the users of the abstraction does not have to think about them. The existence and availability of the resource throughout the lifetime of the object is a "class invariant". In C++ class invariants are set in constructor functions. When the execution leave a scope the objects allocated on its stack are destroyed by calling their destructor functions. That where the resources should be deallocated/freed.

In our case, we want our handles for Graphics API objects to be created automatically, and to be destroyed automatically. Users should not even be aware of those handles for production use. (for debugging accessing them is useful).

```cpp
class Mesh
{
  Mesh()
  {
    // acquire arrays/buffers here and store their handles
  }

  ~Mesh()
  {
    // delete them using their handles here
  }

  // methods to use a mesh (bind, draw etc)
  void bind();
  void unbind();
  void uploadData(std::vector<Vertex> vertices, std::vector<uint32_t> indices);
}
```

To study this for a more general case, let's forget about the specific graphics API (OpenGL) and specific graphics object (Mesh) and specific resources (buffers and array) for the moment. Instead have a generic, mock resource.

```cpp
// ResourceHandler.h
#pragma once

#include <unordered_set>

class ResourceHandler
{
public:
  static int createResource(); // [1]
  static void useResource(int handle); // [2]
  static void deleteResource(int handle); // [3]

private:
  static int counter; // [1, 5]
  static std::unordered_set<int> availableResources; // [4, 5]
};
```

1. Creating a resource will return its handle. Handles are unique integers. Uniqueness comes from by increasing a counter.
2. For using a resource we provide the handle of that resource.
    * We can provide a handle for an existing resource, and simply use it
    * Or accidentally we can provide a non-existing handle. Either a handle that is not created yet, or a handle that belongs to a deleted object. For these cases, the outcome depends on the specific API, in our abstraction let's throw an exception to simulate accessing a non-allocated memory location.
3. Resources can be deleted / freed too when not needed anymore. (Say we unload / deleted a mesh in an Editor)
4. An `unordered_set` of handles, aka `availableResources` tracks currently existing handles.
5. Also everything is static. (didn't bother to use a singleton pattern for simplicity)

A potential implementation of this mock resource could be as below:

```cpp
// ResourceHandler.cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <string>

int ResourceHandler::counter{};
std::unordered_set<int> ResourceHandler::availableResources{};

int ResourceHandler::createResource()
{
  auto [valueIterator, didInsert] = availableResources.insert(++counter);
  assert(didInsert); // since we increment counter at each call ids don't repeat and we should be able to insert
  std::cout << "Acquired Resource[" << *valueIterator << "] from ResourceHandler\n"; // [1]
  return *valueIterator;
}

void ResourceHandler::useResource(int handle)
{
  if (!availableResources.contains(handle))
    throw std::exception{("[Exception] Attempting to use non-existing Resource[" + std::to_string(handle) + "]").c_str()}; // [2]
  std::cout << "Used Resource[" << handle << "]\n"; // [1]
}

void ResourceHandler::deleteResource(int handle)
{
  auto search = availableResources.find(handle);
  if (search == availableResources.end())
  {
    std::cerr << "[Exception] Attempting to delete non-existing Resource[" << std::to_string(handle) << "]\n"; // [2, 3]
    std::terminate();
  }
  availableResources.erase(search);
  std::cout << "Deleted Resource[" << handle << "] via ResourceHandler\n";
}
```

1. Each function prints the handle id and the operation done to stdout for successful operations for studying/debugging purposes
2. Failed operations throw exceptions.
    * I should have just print things to stderr instead of throwing exceptions, which compilated the study. But chose to use them anyway for extra fun. :-)
3. `deleteResource` will be called from destructors. And one should simply not throw an exception from a destructor. Because if this happens while "stack unwinding" (when execution ends a scope and stack variables are destructed in reverse order) the exception mechanism stops the unwinding process and just terminates. There is no one to catch the exception. Therefore, using a print to `cerr` in this case to make my life easier.

We'll also use following macros to simplify the study/debugging

```cpp
// macros.h
#pragma once

#include <iostream>

#define PRINT_EXPR(expression)        \ // [1]
  printf("[expr] %s\n", #expression); \
  expression;

#define EXCEPTION(expression)           \ // [2]
  try                                   \
  {                                     \
    printf("[expr] %s\n", #expression); \
    expression;                         \
  }                                     \
  catch (std::exception & e)            \
  {                                     \
    std::cerr << e.what() << "\n";      \
  }
```

1. `PRINT_EXPR` is a simple trick to print the C++ expression to stdout first, then run that expression.
2. `EXCEPTION` is another trick to again print the C++ expression that is known to throw an exception, then run the expression, catch the exception and print the error message.
    * Not that, the expression is now placed inside a try block. Therefor this cannot be used to create variables in outer scope.

Below is a test of our mock resource system.

```cpp
// TestResourceHandler.cpp
#include "ResourceHandler.h"
#include "macros.h"

int main()
{
  PRINT_EXPR(int handle1 = ResourceHandler::createResource()); // [1]
  PRINT_EXPR(int handle2 = ResourceHandler::createResource());
  PRINT_EXPR(ResourceHandler::useResource(handle1)); // [2]
  EXCEPTION(ResourceHandler::useResource(3)); // [3]
  EXCEPTION(ResourceHandler::deleteResource(3)); // [4]
  PRINT_EXPR(ResourceHandler::useResource(handle2)); // [5]
  PRINT_EXPR(ResourceHandler::deleteResource(handle1)); // [6]
  EXCEPTION(ResourceHandler::useResource(handle1)); // [7]
  EXCEPTION(ResourceHandler::deleteResource(handle1)); // [8]
}
```

1. Create two resources
2. Use the first one
3. attempt to use a non-existing resource, causing an exception
4. attempt to delete a non-existing resource, causing an exception
5. use the  second resource
6. delete the first resource
7. attempt to use deleted first resource, causing an exception
8. attempt to use delete already deleted first resource, causing an exception

Here is the output:

```txt
[expr] int handle1 = ResourceHandler::createResource()
Acquired Resource[1] from ResourceHandler
[expr] int handle2 = ResourceHandler::createResource()
Acquired Resource[2] from ResourceHandler
[expr] ResourceHandler::useResource(handle1)
Used Resource[1]
[expr] ResourceHandler::useResource(5)
[Exception] Attempting to use non-existing Resource[5]
[expr] ResourceHandler::deleteResource(5)
[Exception] Attempting to delete non-existing Resource[5]
[expr] ResourceHandler::useResource(handle2)
Used Resource[2]
[expr] ResourceHandler::deleteResource(handle1)
Deleted Resource[1] via ResourceHandler
[expr] ResourceHandler::useResource(handle1)
[Exception] Attempting to use non-existing Resource[1]
[expr] ResourceHandler::deleteResource(handle1)
[Exception] Attempting to delete non-existing Resource[1]
```

Our mock functions properly. Now let's write some wrappers over this resource.

First wrapper is a simple, obvious one:

```cpp
// Wrapper01.h
#pragma once // [1]
#include <string>

class Wrapper
{
public:
  int handle = -1; // [2]
  std::string state; // [3]

  Wrapper(const std::string &state); // [4]
  ~Wrapper(); // [5]

  void use() const; // [6]
};
```

1. For the rest of this text I'm going to ignore `pragma`, `include` etc statements for brevity.
2. -1 means no resources acquired
3. this string represents/simulates a state. State of a rendering object can be a name, if it's a mesh a vector of vertices and another vector of indices etc.
4. One constructor that takes a state and acquire resource
5. destructor deallocated resource
6. One method to represent various usages of an object (bind, unbind, upload data etc)

It's implementation is as follows:

```cpp
// Wrapper01.cpp
Wrapper::Wrapper(const std::string &state)
    : handle(ResourceHandler::createResource()), state(state) {}

Wrapper::~Wrapper()
{
  ResourceHandler::deleteResource(handle);
}

void Wrapper::use() const
{
  ResourceHandler::useResource(handle);
}
```

Looks nice and clean. But when used in real-life a surprise is excepting us:

```cpp
// TestWrapper01.cpp
int main()
{
  PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w1 = Wrapper("MyMesh")); // [1]
  PRINT_EXPR(w1.use());
  {
    PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w2 = w1); // [2]
    PRINT_EXPR(w2.use());
    std::cout << "--End of inner scope--\n"; // [3]
  }
  EXCEPTION(w1.use()); // [4]
  std::cout << "--End of main scope--\n"; // [5]
}
```

1. Created an object and used it
2. In an inner scope created a new object as a copy of the first one. This could simple be a function call that takes a Wrapper, `func(Wrapper w)`;
3. at the end of its scope the destructor for `w2` will be called, which'll destroy its handle
4. Since `w1` and `w2` were using the same handle, `w1.handle` is still `1` though it's a deleted resource now. Attempt to use causes an exception!
5. Similarly, even if we hadn't use it again, while getting destructed at the end of the main scope, `w1` would throw an exception, because it'll attemp to delete the now deleted resource.

Here is the output of this test

```txt
[expr] Wrapper w1 = Wrapper("MyMesh")
Acquired Resource[1] from ResourceHandler
[expr] w1.use()
Used Resource[1]
[expr] Wrapper w2 = w1
[expr] w2.use()
Used Resource[1]
--End of inner scope--
Deleted Resource[1] via ResourceHandler
[expr] w1.use()
[Exception] Attempting to use non-existing Resource[1]
--End of main scope--
[Exception] Attempting to delete non-existing Resource[1]
```

Now, I'm going to introduce a methodology that I've seen on many StackOverflow posts to make the copy and move constructor/assignments explicit. It's a great way to study these operations in C++. I wish there were some debugging mechanism embedded in compilers / IDEs that can be triggered when constructor/destructers are called.

Add following declarations for copy/move construction/assignment:

```cpp
// Wrapper02.h
  Wrapper(const Wrapper &other); // [1]
  Wrapper &operator=(const Wrapper &other); // [2]
  Wrapper(Wrapper &&other); // [3]
  Wrapper &operator=(Wrapper &&other); // [4]
```

1. A copy constructor
2. A copy assignment
3. A move constructor
4. A move assignment

And implement them as follows:

```cpp
// Wrapper02.cpp
Wrapper::Wrapper(const Wrapper &other)
    : handle(other.handle), state(other.state) // [1]
{
  printf("Copy constructing... (handle, state) dst: (%d, %s), src: (%d, %s)\n", // [2]
    handle, state.c_str(), other.handle, other.state.c_str());
}

Wrapper &Wrapper::operator=(const Wrapper &other)
{
  printf("Copy assigning... (handle, state). dst: (%d, %s), src: (%d, %s)\n",  // [2]
    handle, state.c_str(), other.handle, other.state.c_str());
  handle = other.handle; // [3]
  state = other.state;
  return *this;
}

Wrapper::Wrapper(Wrapper &&other)
    : handle(std::move(other.handle)), state(std::move(other.state)) // [4]
{
  printf("Move constructing... (handle, state) dst: (%d, %s), src: (%d, %s)\n", // [2]
    handle, state.c_str(), other.handle, other.state.c_str());
}

Wrapper &Wrapper::operator=(Wrapper &&other)
{
  handle = std::move(other.handle); // [5]
  state = std::move(other.state);
  printf("Move assigning... (handle, state). dst: (%d, %s), src: (%d, %s)\n", // [2]
    handle, state.c_str(), other.handle, other.state.c_str());
  return *this;
}
```

Here we implemented these operations to be the same as the ones that would be generated by the compiler. Copy constructor/assignment copies each member, move constructor/assignment moves each member. After copying members will have the same values. After move, moved-in members will have the former values of moved-out members, and moved-out members will be "emptied out".

1. This copy constructor takes the object to be copied (src) as a const reference, copies each member into object to be constructor member at initialization.
    * As can be seen, this directly copies the original handle. After construction there are two objects with the same handle. And they are not in sync, i.e. there is no mechanism that makes it sure that if one is destructed, and their handle is deleted, to force the other one to be destructed too.
    * If one of the copies destruced, the handle of the other one will be dangling.
2. A print statement displays the values of dst and src handles and states. This is the neat trick to detect copy and move operations and what's going on in them.
3. Copy assignment is similar to copy construction but individual members are copied from the other, instead of initialized at construction.
4. Move construction is similar to copy construction except each member is moved at initialization not copied.
    * `state(std::move(other.state))` makes the new `state` to point at the memory location of the `char*` make `other.state` a `nullptr`. So, actually, nothing is moved in the memory, `move` does not move things around. :-)
    * a "moved-out" object is expected/assumed not to be used after the move operation.
5. Move assignment does the moves from src to dst object members instead of doing to moves at initialization.

Let's run our test app and see the outputs

```cpp
// TestWrapper02.cpp
Wrapper makeWrapper() // [1]
{
  PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w = {"custom-made"});
  PRINT_EXPR(w.state += " Wrapper");
  PRINT_EXPR(return w);
}

int main()
{
  PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w1 = Wrapper("MyMesh"));
  PRINT_EXPR(w1.use());
  {
    std::cout << "--Begin inner scope--\n";
    PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w2 = w1); // [2]
    PRINT_EXPR(w2.use());
    std::cout << "--End inner scope--\n"; // [3]
  }
  EXCEPTION(w1.use()); // [4]

  PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w3 = makeWrapper()); // [5]
  EXCEPTION(w3.use()); // [6]

  std::cout << "--End main scope--\n"; // [7]
}
```

1. Introducing a helper function to trigger the move construction. When `w` is returned, its content will be moved
2. Thanks to our custom copy construction, will see the copy explicitly
3. At the end of the inner-scope the copy `w2` will be destructed, deleting its handle, which is the same handle has `w1`'s handle.
4. Now we've seen why using `w1` causes an exception
5. Let's do a move operation
6. Because the moved out `w` of `makeWrapper` is destructed, it deletes the resource of its handle, which is the handle of `w3`, hence this triggers an exception too.
7. when the main scope ends it'll destruct `w3` and `w1` both of their resources are already deleted, causing further exceptions.
    * first exception due to deletion of `w3` will happen inside the destructor of `w3`. When destruction exception happens in this situation of "stack unwinding" it'll terminate the program.

output below matches with our understanding from above.

```txt
[expr] Wrapper w1 = Wrapper("MyMesh")
Acquired Resource[1] from ResourceHandler
[expr] w1.use()
Used Resource[1]
--Begin inner scope--
[expr] Wrapper w2 = w1
Copy constructing... (handle, state) dst: (1, MyMesh), src: (1, MyMesh)
[expr] w2.use()
Used Resource[1]
--End inner scope--
Deleted Resource[1] via ResourceHandler
[expr] w1.use()
[Exception] Attempting to use non-existing Resource[1]
[expr] Wrapper w3 = makeWrapper()
[expr] Wrapper w = {"custom-made"}
Acquired Resource[2] from ResourceHandler
[expr] w.state += " Wrapper"
[expr] return w
Move constructing... (handle, state) dst: (2, custom-made Wrapper), src: (2, )
Deleted Resource[2] via ResourceHandler
[expr] w3.use()
[Exception] Attempting to use non-existing Resource[2]
--End main scope--
[Exception] Attempting to delete non-existing Resource[2] (might terminate IRL)
[Exception] Attempting to delete non-existing Resource[1] (might terminate IRL)
```

The moral of the story is, when a resources is taken care of / abstracted away in a RAII manner, we have to consider copy and move operations too. What should we do about copies and moves?

About copies two potential options we've are as following:

* A) When copying, create a new handle using ResourceHandler and update the state.
* B) Delete copy constructor, i.e. don't allow copies.

```cpp
// Option A (cpp)
Wrapper::Wrapper(const Wrapper &other)
    : handle(ResourceHandler::createResource()), state(other.state) { ... } // [1]

Wrapper &Wrapper::operator=(const Wrapper &other)
{
  handle = ResourceHandler::createResource(); // [1]
  state = other.state;
  ...
}

// Option B (header)
Wrapper(const Wrapper &other) = delete; // [2]
Wrapper &operator=(const Wrapper &other) = delete; // [2]
```

1. after copies dst and src will have the same state / same "rendering object", with different, unique resource handles.
    * they can be manipulated (processed or deleted) separately.
2. `Wrapper w2 = w1;` is not a valid code anymore. Compiler will throw an error at compilation time.

Which is the right choice depends on the project. If it's a creative coding project, where we need copies of the same mesh (say it's a genetic algorithm where we create N copies of a mesh and process each differently and chose best fits and repeat) then a copy makes sense. However, for a rendering library, this make it too easy to misuse and accidentally create thousands of allocations of the same resource type and that many copies.

For moves, we should "empty-out" the moved-out object. This can be done by setting the handle of `src` to `-1` again. `dst` will own the handle and `src` will own nothing.

```cpp
Wrapper::Wrapper(Wrapper &&other)
    : handle(std::move(other.handle)), state(std::move(other.state) + "(moved)") // [1]
{
  other.handle = -3; // [2]
}

Wrapper &Wrapper::operator=(Wrapper &&other) // [3]
{
  handle = std::move(other.handle);
  state = std::move(other.state) + "(moved)";
  other.handle = -3;
  return *this;
}
```

1. We are `std::move`ing other members into newly constructed class. With one tweak to append `"(moved)"` to the state to keep historical record of the move.
2. since handle is an integer, a primitive/fundamental data type, the variable is not "moved-out" by the move operation. Again for book-keeping purposes setting it to `-3` manually. (Without bookkeeping just set it to `-1`.)
3. Move assignment does the same, but instead of creating a new object, sets the members of an existing object via moves.

Let's see this form of the wrapper

```cpp
// Wrapper03.h
class Wrapper
{
public:
  int handle = -1; // [1] -1 means uninitialized, -2 means deleted, -3 means moved
  std::string state;

  Wrapper();
  Wrapper(std::string state);
  ~Wrapper();

  Wrapper(const Wrapper &other) = delete; // [2]
  Wrapper &operator=(const Wrapper &other) = delete;

  Wrapper(Wrapper &&other);
  Wrapper &operator=(Wrapper &&other);

  void use() const;
};
```

1. For keeping historical records, we'll set uninitialized/not-yet-allocated handle to -1, after deleting in a destructor we'll set the handle to `-2` (which won't be observable later, since the object will be dead), and after a `move`, moved-out handle value will be `-1`. We could have used `-1` for all of these cases.
2. Observe that we explicitly delete copy ops.

```cpp
Wrapper::Wrapper() // [1]
    : handle(ResourceHandler::createResource()), state("<0-state>")
{
  printf("Constructing... (handle, state) (%d, %s)\n", handle, state.c_str());
}

Wrapper::Wrapper(std::string state)
    : handle(ResourceHandler::createResource()), state(state)
{
  printf("Constructing... (handle, state) (%d, %s)\n", handle, state.c_str());
}

Wrapper::~Wrapper()
{
  printf("Destructing... (handle, state) (%d, %s) -> (-2, %s(destructed))\n", // [2]
    handle, state.c_str(), state.c_str());
  if (handle > 0) // [3]
  {
    ResourceHandler::deleteResource(handle);
    handle = -2; // [4]
  }
  state += "(destructed)"; // [4]
}

Wrapper::Wrapper(Wrapper &&other)
    : handle(std::move(other.handle)), state(std::move(other.state) + "(moved)") // [5]
{
  other.handle = -3; // [5]
  printf("Move constructing... (handle, state) dst: (%d, %s), src: (%d, %s)\n", 
    handle, state.c_str(), other.handle, other.state.c_str());
}

Wrapper &Wrapper::operator=(Wrapper &&other)
{
  handle = std::move(other.handle);
  state = std::move(other.state) + "(moved)";
  other.handle = -3; // [5]
  printf("Move constructing... (handle, state) dst: (%d, %s), src: (%d, %s)\n", 
    handle, state.c_str(), other.handle, other.state.c_str());
  return *this;
}

void Wrapper::use() const
{
  printf("Wrapper [%s] using Resource[%d]\n", state.c_str(), handle);
  ResourceHandler::useResource(handle);
}
```

1. default constructor without any arguments. Could be useful for creating empty objects that'll be manipulated later via factory methods of format `makeSomething(Wrapper& w)`.
2. Debug prints indicate the change from src to dst, where dst being the deleted object
3. One trick we need to pay attention is that, after move operations moved-out object does not own any resources.
    * We set the handle to `-3` (or `-1`) indicating that this handle does not refer to any GPU resources anymore. Therefor, we should not call the `ResourceHandler::deleteResource()` over this handle.
    * If we don't do this, object might be used, or even if we don't use it, when it's being destructed it'll attempt to delete the resource, which will already be deleted.
4. `-2` is to just indicate the deleted-ness of this object, similarly appending `"(destructed)"` to its state.
5. Move constructor appends to new state `"(moved)"` and sets old handle to `-3` for book-keeping. The latter is essential, and prevents the resource from being deleted while moved-out object is destructed.

Let's run a comprehensive test to see our RAII class in its full glory:

```cpp
Wrapper makeWrapper_1() // [6]
{
  Wrapper w;
  w.state = "made with makeWrapper_1()";
  return w;
}

Wrapper makeWrapper_2()
{
  return Wrapper{std::string("made with makeWrapper_2()")};
}

void separator() { std::cout << "***************************\n"; }

int main()
{
  PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w1);
  PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w2{"MyMesh"});
  separator();

  // w1 = w2; // copy assignment not allowed // [1]

  // PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w3{w2}); // copy-construction not allowed // [1]

  PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w3{std::move(w2)}); // [2]
  EXCEPTION(w2.use());
  PRINT_EXPR(w3.use());
  separator();

  PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w4{Wrapper{"YourMesh"}}); // [3]
  PRINT_EXPR(w4.use());
  separator();

1. Since copy construction/assignment ops are deleted, uncommenting these lines prevents the code form compilation
2. We trigger a move of the wrapper object explicitly. `w2` is moved-out hence unusable, whereas `w3` now owns its resource and can be used.
3. This is neither copy-construction, nor move-construction. Compiler does a neat trick and the object `w4` is allocated directly in the main scope using `Wrapper(std::string state)` constructor. :-O
4. is basically the same as [2] however, this time, we move a temporary (rvalue?), instead of a variable (lvalue?)
5. This case demonstrates a move assignment. How the temporary object is "moved-out" and `w6` has the "moved-in" object.
6. Demonstrates a factory function. It starts with an empty wrapper and updates/constructs its state.
    * When returning no copying will happen, just a move. So, it should still be efficient if state is not too cumbersome.
7. This demonstrates a special kind of factory function which does the magic called "Return Value Optimization" (RVO).
    * According to the code a Wrapper is constructed in the scope/stack of `makeWrapper_2()` function. However, in execution, that object is allocated in the main functions scope :-O
    * There is a more advanced optimization called "named return value optimization", where the object can even be assigned to a variable first. However, [6] cannot do that, because we are changing the variable's state arbitrarily before returning it.

If we go over this output, and compare it with our notes above we'll see that they match.

Now, we have a functioning resource wrapping abstraction that can be allocated on stack, resources will be acquired at initialization/construction and will be automatically deleted when the object goes out of its scope. Wrapper cannot be copied because we deleted copy operations, but can only be moved. This API is for allocating objects on stack.

Also all these constraints on being "non-copiable but movable" sounds very similar to `std::unique_ptr`. Basically, we've implemented the functionality provided by unique pointers with scope allocations.

We can improve our stack-based implementation by allowing copies, where all copies share the same handle value, and keep track of number of copies, and only delete the resource when the number of copies becomes 0. That'll be very similar to `std::shared_ptr` and we'd be rediscovering reference counting feature of shared pointers.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can just use shared pointers for our wrappers. This last idea is to constrain the creation of wrapper objects only to heap, i.e. only dynamic object allocation. Once the object is created we can as many shared pointer as we want. And when the last shared pointer goes out of scope the deallocation happens. We don't have to deal with implementation of copy/move operations, on the contrary we should delete them.

Let's see the final Wrapper design for dynamic-only allocations

```cpp
// Wrapper04.h
class Wrapper
{
private:
  int handle = -1; // [1]
  Wrapper(const std::string &state); // [2]

public:
  std::string state;
  ~Wrapper();

  static std::shared_ptr<Wrapper> makeWrapper(const std::string &state); // [3]

  Wrapper(const Wrapper &other) = delete; // [4]
  Wrapper &operator=(const Wrapper &other) = delete;
  Wrapper(Wrapper &&other) = delete;
  Wrapper &operator=(Wrapper &&other) = delete;

  void use() const;
};
```

1. Should have made the handle private for previous cases too
2. Making the constructor privte. This prevents any stack allocation. :-O
3. Let give this class a static factory function. It'll return a shared pointer.
4. Delete all copy/move operations, to prevent dereferencing the pointer and start making copies on stack.

Potential implementation

```cpp
// Wrapper04.cpp
Wrapper::Wrapper(const std::string &state)
    : handle(ResourceHandler::createResource()), state(state) {}

Wrapper::~Wrapper()
{
  ResourceHandler::deleteResource(handle);
}

std::shared_ptr<Wrapper> Wrapper::makeWrapper(const std::string &state)
{
  // can't use make_shared because it reference counting mechanism cannot access to private member Wrapper constructor
  // return std::make_shared<Wrapper>(state); // [2]
  return std::shared_ptr<Wrapper>(new Wrapper(state)); // [1]
}

void Wrapper::use() const
{
  ResourceHandler::useResource(handle);
}
```

Only novelty here is the factory function. Note that the constructor is not accessible from outside of the class.

1. First we create a raw pointer using the private constructor, then give that to shared pointer constructor to turn it into a shared pointer.
2. Unfortunately, by making the constructor private, we lost our ability to use `make_shared` for creation of the shared pointer. `make_shared` is more performant because it does fewer allocations, and forwards construction parameters. Whereas what we are doing here is more than one allocations. :-(
      * AFAIU the reason is that the reference counting mechanism that make_shared uses is separate system that requires access to constructor of to-be-dynamically-created-class.
      * I saw hacks that re-enables `make_shared` by making the references counting entity a `friend` of `Wrapper`. But reference counting is implementation/compiler dependent and one hack that works on Visual Studio 2022 (that I'm using for this study) won't work for another version of VS or for another compiles (gcc, clang etc)
      * Therefore this solution is not ideal, but it's much less complicated than the alternatives I've found on the internet that enables `make_shared`. I'm not expecting calls to resource wrapper factory functions to be frequent enough to make this a significant performance issue.

Here is a test program for dynamic wrapper design:

```cpp
// TestWrapper04.cpp
int main()
{
  PRINT_EXPR(auto w1 = Wrapper::makeWrapper("MyMesh")); // [1]
  PRINT_EXPR(w1->use());
  std::cout << w1->state << " reference count: " << w1.use_count() << "\n"; // [2]
  {
    std::cout << "--Begin inner scope--\n";
    PRINT_EXPR(std::shared_ptr<Wrapper> w2 = w1); // [2]
    PRINT_EXPR(w2->use());
    std::cout << w2->state << " reference count: " << w2.use_count() << "\n"; // [2]
    std::cout << "--End inner scope--\n";
  }
  PRINT_EXPR(w1->use()); // [3]
  std::cout << w1->state << " reference count: " << w1.use_count() << "\n"; // [2]

  // Wrapper w4{"cant-create-this"}; // inaccessible function / constructor -> can't compile // [4]
  // PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w4 = *w3); // deleted function / copy constructor -> can't compile // [5]
  // PRINT_EXPR(Wrapper w5 = std::move(*w3)); // deleted function / move constructor -> can't compile // [5]
  PRINT_EXPR(const Wrapper &w6 = *w3); // [6]

  std::cout << "--End main scope--\n";
}
```

1. We could have chosen to make the destructor `~Wrapper()` to be private instead of the constructor. That'll let us use `auto w1 = std::make_shared<Wrapper>("MyMesh")`. But this probably will provide a neater API.
2. When we copy the pointer in inner scope, we are not allocating a new resource, we are just adding another pointer that references to the same resource wrapper, which can be seen by the increase in reference count (`use_count()`), which decreases when the copied shared pointer dies at the end of inner scope.
3. We can still use the wrapper becase shared pointer `w1` is still alive.
4. Constructor is private, can't access
5. copy/move ops are deleted, can't call
6. getting a references to dereferenced wrapper object is OK because it's neither a copy nor a move.

Here is the output:

```txt
[expr] auto w1 = Wrapper::makeWrapper("MyMesh")
Acquired Resource[1] from ResourceHandler
[expr] w1->use()
Used Resource[1]
MyMesh reference count: 1
--Begin inner scope--
[expr] std::shared_ptr<Wrapper> w2 = w1
[expr] w2->use()
Used Resource[1]
MyMesh reference count: 2
--End inner scope--
[expr] w1->use()
Used Resource[1]
MyMesh reference count: 1
[expr] auto w3 = Wrapper::makeWrapper("made-via-factory-function")
Acquired Resource[2] from ResourceHandler
[expr] w3->use()
Used Resource[2]
[expr] const Wrapper &w6 = *w3
--End main scope--
Deleted Resource[2] via ResourceHandler
Deleted Resource[1] via ResourceHandler
```

Observe that there are no exceptions and the implementation of the Wrapper was much simpler.

4b) also, this is a simple theoretical study. In real-life, usually it's not the best to allocate one resource per object, we usually bundle multiple objects into single resource. For example, allocate a big vertex buffer and fill it with mesh data of multiple meshes, or, have texture atlases that contain multiple textures etc.

Also, discuss factor functions/methods. We don't want to inherit from `Mesh` to be able to generate specific geometries such as `Quad`, `Cube`, `UVSphere`, `IcoSphere`...

---

* next: this Mesh abstraction by itself is not enough. It can be good for simple applications where each mesh is hard-coded etc., for a generative art project. We let the main scope to own the mesh. However, in a more realistic project, we want to have another abstraction to manage all of our assets including Mesh, such as Textures, Materials etc. We should be able to load and unload a mesh, put it into a scene or remove from a scene, have means of accessing it later etc. (say for mouse picking).
  * can have a `std::unordered_map<std::string, Mesh> where string is the "name"/"id" of the Mesh in our asset manager. Or even a simple mechanism could be to have a vector of assets.

```cpp
struct Assets 
{ 
  std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Mesh>> meshes;
  std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Texture>> textures;
  // etc
};
```

Of course, better to have further methods to manage these assets (load, delete, access by id, search). But that's a topic for another day.
